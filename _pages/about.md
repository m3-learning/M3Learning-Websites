The **M³-Learning Group** at Drexel University integrates oxide synthesis, advanced spectroscopy, and machine learning to develop intelligent pathways for the design and discovery of multifunctional materials.

Our research spans:
- **Oxide Synthesis**: From pulsed-laser deposition to unit-cell-level engineering, enabling control over emergent functionalities.
- **Advanced Spectroscopy**: In situ and in operando spectroscopies to unravel complex structure-property relationships.
- **Machine Learning**: Augmenting human intelligence with interpretable AI models for materials informatics and data-driven design.

Led by [Professor Joshua C. Agar](https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/A/agar-joshua/), our interdisciplinary team is reshaping how we explore and understand materials.
