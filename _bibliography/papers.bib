  abstract   = {Future electronics will undoubtedly require natural integration
                at the system, device and package level in the form of a
                functional, flexible package. Functional, flexible electronics
                expand the functionality of devices allowing
                morphological-electronic response for ergonomic and natural
                interfaces between the device and its surroundings. Recent
                technological successes have been able to fabricate functional,
                flexible electronics, however have all failed to develop a
                package capable of meeting the stringent cost, reliability and
                performance required of consumer electronics. We demonstrate the
                application of electrically conductive adhesive technology to
                produce low cost, flexible electronics without metallization. We
                have shown the capability of fabrication of highly conductive
                Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) (rho~7x10-4 Ω-cm) by incorporation
                of 80 wt\% bimodal distribution of micron sized silver flakes.
                PDMS is both the ideal substrate and composite matrix material
                due to its unique properties; PDMS is optically transparent,
                viscoelastic, chemically and thermally stable, highly flexible,
                hydrophobic and can easily be molded with high resolution and
                aspect ratio. These unique properties of PDMS allow for high
                resolution molds to be prepared from photolithographically
                defined substrates. Screen printing of electrically conductive
                PDMS into these molds with micro- sized features creates a low
                cost, flexible electronic package. We have coined this package
                PDMS-in-PDMS. We show that PDMS ECA can be prepared by curing a
                novel formulation of PDMS at curing temperatures of 150 °C for
                15 minutes. Upon curing, the ECA undergoes a transition from
                insulating to conductive. TMA results have shown that this
                transition is due to ECA shrinkage >20\%. Furthermore, we show
                simultaneous conductivity and tensile strain measurements to
                show the electrical properties of PDMS ECA are unaffected by
                tensile strains of >40\%. We show the feasibility of this
                technology to create low cost, flexible devices without the need
                for metallization.},

  abstract   = {Embedded paper electronics is a promising solution for the
                future of electronics, and thus the goal for this paper is to
                show the pathway toward achieving inkjet solutions for the
                realization of complex circuitry on the cheapest synthetic
                material made by humankind: PAPER. A direct write technology,
                inkjet printing transfers the designed pattern directly to the
                substrate. Inkjet technologies have gained a lot of ground as a
                more accurate and economic fabrication method than traditional
                lithography.The challenge of this work is to identify the right
                materials and to show the printability of all the building
                blocks of an organic field-effect transistor (OTFT). For the
                semiconductor, a highly soluble pentacene precursor,
                13,6-N-Sulfinylacetamidopentacene, is proposed. Anisole, a high
                boiling point solvent is chosen to insure proper jetting of the
                solution. The solution jets well and it has to be used right
                after preparation as its printability degrades with time. For
                the gate dielectric, two solutions are proposed: (i) using the
                paper itself as an insulator and print a bottom gate device on
                both sides of a double sided glossy paper, (ii) a pentacene
                impurity, of 6,13-pentacenequinone (PQ), in a top gate
                configuration, which may improve the device mobility by reducing
                the scattering sites at the semiconductor-dielectric interface.
                For the electrodes, a printable nano-particle based silver ink
                has to be modified to match the work function with pentacene, or
                replaced with an alternate printable material like Carbon
                Nanotubes (CNTs). Preliminary electrical testing of the
                pentacene film printed directly on paper shows good conduction
                properties for a 25 μm channel length. Further improvement of
                the pentacene film performance is proposed. This work
                establishes the foundation for the first fully printed OTFT on
                paper.},

  abstract   = {The modern emphasis on green technologies has caused the
                electronics industry to seek alternative solutions to lead-
                based interconnections. Electrically conductive adhesive (ECAs)
                composed of metallic fillers within a polymer matrix have
                received the majority of the interest in lead-free interconnect
                technology. However, ECAs are still unable to meet the demands
                of high performance consumer electronics. Previous research
                recognized a critical filler concentration where there is a
                dramatic increase in conductivity, followed by a plateau.
                Researchers have labeled this transition as evidence of a
                percolation, implying a continuous interconnected metallic
                network. Our work comprised of a series of "proof of concept"
                type experiments deconstructs the myth of percolation and
                emphasize the functional role of the polymer matrix. From a
                theoretical standpoint direct metal to metal contact is not
                feasible since silver particles coated with short chain acids
                are easily wet by the polymer matrix. Assembly conducted under
                low mechanical stresses is unable to displace the adsorbed
                surfactant to form metallic contact. Moreover, preparation of a
                high K epoxy (Dielectric Constant ~5.5), Co(III)
                acetylacetonates (Co(III) AcAcs) doped diglycidyl ether of
                bisphenol F had unstable conductivities orders of magnitude
                lower than the control samples; under similar applied DC.
                Dielectric constant has a minimal effect if metal to metal
                contact is the dominant charge transport mechanism. However,
                tunneling through materials with high dielectric constant
                impedes the tunneling efficiency. We clearly demonstrate that
                charge transport at the interface occurs via secondary
                conductivity pathways, dominated by thermally assisted tunneling
                mechanisms. The importance of these secondary conductivity
                mechanisms is highly dependent on the particle-thin film
                dielectric interaction. This revolutionary discovery provides a
                new approach for scientists and engineers to improve the
                performance of electrically conductive adhesives through the
                incorporation of electrically functional matrix materials.},

  abstract    = {The electronics industry is shifting its emphasis from reducing
                 transistor size and operational frequency to increasing device
                 integration, reducing form factor and increasing the interface
                 of electronics with their surroundings. This new emphasis has
                 created increased demands on the electronic package. To
                 accomplish the goals to increase device integration and
                 interfaces will undoubtedly require new materials with
                 increased functionality both electrically and mechanically.
                 This thesis focuses on developing new interconnect and
                 printable conductive materials capable of providing power,
                 ground and signal transmission with enhanced electrical
                 performance and mechanical flexibility and robustness. More
                 specifically, we develop: 1.) A new understanding of the
                 conduction mechanism in electrically conductive composites
                 (ECC). 2.) Develop highly conductive stretchable silicone ECC
                 (S-ECC) via in-situ nanoparticle formation and sintering. 3.)
                 Fabricate and test stretchable radio frequency devices based on
                 S-ECC. 4.) Develop techniques and processes necessary to
                 fabricate a stretchable package for stretchable electronic and
                 radio frequency devices. In this thesis we provide convincing
                 evidence that conduction in ECC occurs predominantly through
                 secondary charge transport mechanism (tunneling, hopping).
                 Furthermore, we develop a stretchable silicone-based ECC which,
                 through the incorporation of a special additive, can form and
                 sinter nanoparticles on the surface of the metallic conductive
                 fillers. This sintering process decreases the contact
                 resistance and enhances conductivity of the composite. The
                 conductive composite developed has the best reported
                 conductivity, stretchability and reliability. Using this S-ECC
                 we fabricate a stretchable microstrip line with good
                 performance up to 6 GHz and a stretchable antenna with good
                 return loss and bandwidth. The work presented provides a
                 foundation to create high performance stretchable electronic
                 packages and radio frequency devices for curvilinear spaces.
                 Future development of these technologies will enable the
                 fabrication of ultra-low stress large area interconnects,
                 reconfigurable antennas and other electronic and RF devices
                 where the ability to flex and stretch provides additional

                  polymer composites at low temperatures for flexible electronic
                  applications have increased significantly. Here, we describe a
                  novel approach for the preparation of flexible highly
                  conductive polymer composites (resistivity: 2.5 x 10-5 Ω cm)
                  at a low temperature (150 °C), enabling the wide use of low
                  cost, flexible substrates such as paper and polyethylene
                  terephthalate (PET). The approach involves (i) in situ
                  reduction of silver carboxylate on the surface of silver
                  flakes by a flexible epoxy (diglycidyl ether of polypropylene
                  glycol) to form highly surface reactive nano/submicron-sized
                  particles; (ii) the in situ formed nano/submicron-sized
                  particles facilitate the sintering between silver flakes
                  during curing. Morphology and Raman studies indicated that the
                  improved electrical conductivity was the result of sintering
                  and direct metal-metal contacts between silver flakes. This
                  approach developed for the preparation of flexible highly
                  conductive polymer composites offers significant advantages,
                  including simple low temperature processing, low cost, low

                  technologies, flexibility while maintaining high conductivity,
                  and tunable mechanical properties. The developed flexible
                  highly conductive materials with these advantages are

                graphene, which exhibits an ultrahigh capacitance. This
                solvothermal method allows a fine control of the density of
                functionalities on graphene surface. The structure of resulting
                functionalized graphene is characterized by X-ray photoelectron
                spectroscopy (XPS), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), FTIR and
                Raman. Pseudocapacitance is provided by functionalities on
                graphene surface, such as carboxyl, carbonyl and hydroxyl. The
                significance of these functional also includes improving the
                wetting properties of electrode material, especially for
                supercapacitors using aqueous electrolyte. However, there is a
                penalty for functionalities since these oxygen-containing
                functional groups will disrupt the π-conjugated system and lower
                the electrical conductivity. Therefore for functionalized
                graphene as supercapacitor, a tradeoff exists between the high
                psudeocapacitance and low conductivity, both are arising from
                the surface functionalities. Our systematic study shows a
                successful control of the density of functionalities, which is
                essential to achieve high performance of graphene-based
                supercapacitors. The capacitance of graphene is measured in a
                three electrode system using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
                galvanostatic charging/discharging techniques. At a proper

                a discharging current of 0.1 A/g in H2SO4 solutions. The
                superior capacitive performance of functionalized graphene
                demonstrates the importance of surface property engineering,
                which will greatly promote the study and application of
                graphene-based supercapacitors.},

                  properties of ferroelectric materials. But despite extensive
                  work in this regard, few studies have explored the effect of
                  epitaxial strain on PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3. Here we explore how
                  epitaxial strain impacts the structure and properties of 75 nm
                  thick films of the morphotropic phase boundary composition.
                  Single-phase, fully epitaxial films are found to possess
                  “relaxed” or nearly “relaxed” structures despite growth on a
                  range of substrates. Subsequent studies of the dielectric and
                  ferroelectric properties reveal films with low leakage
                  currents facilitating the measurement of low-loss hysteresis
                  loops down to measurement frequencies of 30 mHz and dielectric
                  response at background dc bias fields as large as 850 kV/cm.
                  Despite a seeming insensitivity of the crystal structure to
                  the epitaxial strain, the polarization and switching
                  characteristics are found to vary with substrate. The elastic
                  constraint from the substrate produces residual strains that
                  dramatically alter the electric-field response including
                  quenching domain wall contributions to the dielectric
                  permittivity and suppressing field-induced structural
                  reorientation. These results demonstrate that substrate
                  mediated epitaxial strain of PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 is more complex
                  than in conventional ferroelectrics with discretely defined
                  phases, yet can have a marked effect on the material and its

               structures in ferroelectric thin films. New avenues of strain
               engineering based on varying the composition at the nanometer
               scale have been shown to generate symmetry breaking and large
               strain gradients culminating in large built-in potentials. In
               this work, we develop routes to deterministically control these
               built-in potentials by exploiting the interplay between strain
               gradients, strain accommodation, and domain formation in
               compositionally graded PbZr1-xTixO3 heterostructures. We
               demonstrate that variations in the nature of the compositional
               gradient and heterostructure thickness can be used to control
               both the crystal and domain structures and give rise to
               nonintuitive evolution of the built-in potential, which does not
               scale directly with the magnitude of the strain gradient as would
               be expected. Instead, large built-in potentials are observed in
               compositionally-graded heterostructures that contain (1)
               compositional gradients that traverse chemistries associated with
               structural phase boundaries (such as the morphotropic phase
               boundary) and (2) ferroelastic domain structures. In turn, the
               built-in potential is observed to be dependent on a combination
               of flexoelectric effects (i.e., polarization-strain gradient
               coupling), chemical-gradient effects (i.e., polarization-chemical
               potential gradient coupling), and local inhomogeneities (in
               structure or chemistry) that enhance strain (and/or chemical
               potential) gradients such as areas with nonlinear lattice
               parameter variation with chemistry or near ferroelastic domain
               boundaries. Regardless of origin, large built-in potentials act
               to suppress the dielectric permittivity, while having minimal
               impact on the magnitude of the polarization, which is important
               for the optimization of these materials for a range of

              With increasing heterostructure thickness and misfit dislocation
              formation at the buried interface, a periodic, modulated strain
              field is generated that alters the adatom binding energy and, in

              2D growth to ordered, 3D-island formation. The results suggest
              that the periodically varying binding energy can lead to
              inhomogeneous adsorption kinetics causing preferential growth at

               routes to control it are of great technological significance.
               This work provides systematic experimental evidence of the role
               of defects in affecting ferroelectric-polarization switching and
               utilizes the ability to deterministically create and spatially
               locate point defects in PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films via
               focused-helium-ion bombardment and the subsequent
               defect-polarization coupling as a knob for on-demand control of
               ferroelectric switching (e.g., coercivity and imprint). At
               intermediate ion doses (0.22–2.2×1014ionscm−2), the dominant
               defects (isolated point defects and small clusters) show a weak
               interaction with domain walls (pinning potentials from
               200–500KMVcm−1), resulting in small and symmetric changes in the
               coercive field. At high doses (0.22–1×1015ionscm−2), on the other
               hand, the dominant defects (larger defect complexes and clusters)
               strongly pin domain-wall motion (pinning potentials from 500 to
               1600KMVcm−1), resulting in a large increase in the coercivity and
               imprint, and a reduction in the polarization. This local control

              materials, enabling a plethora of applications and captivating the
              attention of the scientific community for over half a century.
              Many previous studies considered ferroelectric switching as a
              purely physical process, whereas polarization is fully controlled
              by the superposition of electric fields. However, screening charge
              is required for thermodynamic stability of the single domain state
              that is of interest in many technological applications. The
              screening process has always been assumed to be fast; thus, the
              rate-limiting phenomena were believed to be domain nucleation and
              domain wall dynamics. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that
              polarization switching under an atomic force microscopy tip leads
              to reversible ionic motion in the top 3 nm of PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3
              surface layer. This evidence points to a strong chemical component
              to a process believed to be purely physical and has major
              implications for understanding ferroelectric materials, making
              ferroelectric devices, and interpreting local ferroelectric

               a polydomain ferroelectric can have profound effects on its
               electrothermal susceptibilities. Here, the role of such
               ferroelastic domains on the pyroelectric and electrocaloric
               response is experimentally investigated in thin films of the
               tetragonal ferroelectric PbZr0.2 Ti0.8 O3 . By utilizing
               epitaxial strain, a rich set of ferroelastic polydomain states
               spanning a broad thermodynamic phase space are stabilized. Using
               temperature-dependent scanning-probe microscopy, X-ray
               diffraction, and high-frequency phase-sensitive pyroelectric
               measurements, the propensity of domains to reconfigure under a
               temperature perturbation is quantitatively studied. In turn, the
               ``extrinsic'' contributions to pyroelectricity exclusively due to
               changes between the ferroelastic domain population is elucidated
               as a function of epitaxial strain. Further, using highly
               sensitive thin-film resistive thermometry, direct electrocaloric
               temperature changes are measured on these polydomain thin films
               for the first time. The results demonstrate that temperature- and
               electric-field-driven domain interconversion under compressive
               strain diminish both the pyroelectric and the electrocaloric
               effects, while both these susceptibilities are enhanced due to
               the exact-opposite effect from the extrinsic contributions under
               tensile strain.",

  abstract      = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are broadly used
               in many engineering and physics fields. CFD requires the solution
               of the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations under complex flow and
               boundary conditions. However, applications of CFD simulations are
               computationally limited by the availability, speed, and
               parallelism of high-performance computing. To address this,
               machine learning techniques have been employed to create
               data-driven approximations for CFD to accelerate computational
               efficiency. Unfortunately, these methods predominantly depend on
               large labeled CFD datasets, which are costly to procure at the
               scale required for robust model development. In response, we
               introduce a weakly supervised approach that, through a
               multichannel input capturing boundary and geometric conditions,
               solves steady-state N-S equations. Our method achieves
               state-of-the-art results without relying on labeled simulation
               data, instead using a custom data-driven and physics-informed
               loss function and small-scale solutions to prime the model for
               solving the N-S equations. By training stacked models, we enhance
               resolution and predictability, yielding high-quality numerical
               solutions to N-S equations without hefty computational demands.
               Remarkably, our model, being highly adaptable, produces solutions
               on a 512 x 512 domain in a swift 7 ms, outpacing traditional CFD
               solvers by a factor of 1,000. This paves the way for real-time
               predictions on consumer hardware and Internet of Things devices,

                   data, at rates exceeding 100kfps, on $\textit\{in situ\}$
                   Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware to track
                   magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mode evolution and generate
                   control signals in real-time. Our system utilizes a
                   convolutional neural network (CNN) model which predicts the
                   $n$=1 MHD mode amplitude and phase using camera images with
                   better accuracy than other tested non-deep-learning-based
                   methods. By implementing this model directly within the
                   standard FPGA readout hardware of the high-speed camera
                   diagnostic, our mode tracking system achieves a total
                   trigger-to-output latency of 17.6$\mu$s and a throughput of
                   up to 120kfps. This study at the High Beta Tokamak-Extended

                transition to real-time analysis and closed-loop microscope

  title      = {Extremely Noisy {4D-TEM} Strain Mapping Using Cycle Consistent
                Spatial Transforming Autoencoders},
  author     = {Qin, Shuyu and Tran, Nhan and Agar, Joshua C},
  abstract   = {Atomic-scale imaging of 2D and quantum materials benefits from
                precisely extracting crystallographic strain, shear, and rotation
                to understand their mechanical, optical and electronic
                properties. One powerful technique is 4D-TEM (4-dimensional
                transmission electron microscopy), where a convergent electron
                beam is scanned across a sample while measuring the resulting
                diffraction pattern with a direct electron detector. Extracting
                the crystallographic strain, shear, and rotation from this data
                relies either on cross-correlation of probe templates (e.g.,
                implemented in py4DSTEM) or determining the center of mass (CoM)
                of the diffraction peaks. These algorithms have limitations. They
                require manual preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning, are
                sensitive to signal-to-noise, and generally are difficult to
                automate. There is no one-size-fits-all algorithm. Recently,
                machine learning techniques have been used to assist in analyzing
                4D-TEM data, however, these models do not possess the capacity to
                learn the strain, rotation, or translation instead they just
                learn an approximation that almost aways tends to be correct as
                long as the test examples are within the training dataset
                distribution. We developed a novel neural network structure --
                Cycle Consistent Spatial Transforming Autoencoder (CC-ST-AE).
                This model takes a set of diffraction images and trains a sparse
                autoencoder to classify an observed diffraction pattern to a
                dictionary of learned ``averaged'' diffraction patterns.
                Secondly, it learns the affine transformation matrix parameters
                that minimizes the reconstruction error between the dictionary
                and the input diffraction pattern. Since the affine
                transformation includes translation, strain, shear, and rotation,
                we can parsimoniously learn the strain tensor. To ensure the
                model is physics conforming, we train the model cycle
                consistently, by ensuring the inverse affine transformation from
                the dictionary results in the original diffraction pattern. We
                validated this model on a number of benchmark tasks including: A
                Simulated 4D TEM data of $WS_2$ and $WSe_2$ lateral
                heterostructures (noise free) with a ground truth of the strain,
                rotation and shear parameters. Secondly, we test this model on
                experimental 4D TEM on 2D heterostructures of tungsten disulfide
                ($WS_2$) and tungsten diselenide ($WSe_2$). This model shows
                several significant improvements including: 1. When tested on
                simulated data, the model can recover the ground truth with
                minimal error. 2. The model can learn the rotation and strain on
                noisy diffraction patterns where CoM failed, and significantly
                outperforms template matching (py4DSTEM). 3. Our model can
                accommodate large and continuous rotations difficult to obtain
                with other methods. 4. Our model is more robust to noisy data. 5.
                Our model can map the strain, shear and rotation; identify
                dislocation and ripples; and distinguish background and sample
                area automatically. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how
                embedding physical concepts into unsupervised neural networks can
                simplify, automate, and accelerate analysis pipelines while
                simultaneously leveraging stochastic averaging that improves
                robustness on noisy data. This algorithmic concept can be
                extended to include other physical phenomena (e.g., polarization,
                sample tilt), can be used in automated experiments, and can be
                applied to other applications in materials characterization.

  abstract   = {Utilizing computational methods to extract actional information
                from scientific data is essential due to the time-consuming and

                serve the purpose, equipping computational methods with physical
                rules is necessary. Integrating deep learning models with
                symmetry awareness has emerged as a promising approach to
                significantly improve symmetry detection in experimental data,
                with techniques such as parameter sharing and novel convolutional
                layers enhancing symmetry recognition.[1,2,3,4,5,6] However, the
                challenge of integrating physical principles, such as symmetry,
                into these models persists. To address this, we have developed
                benchmarking datasets and training frameworks, exploring three
                perspectives to classify wallpaper group symmetries effectively.
                Our study demonstrates the limitations of deep learning models in

                   microscopy give unprecedented possibilities for structure
                   analysis at the nanoscale. In electronic and quantum
                   materials, this new capability gives access to, for example,
                   emergent chiral structures and symmetry-breaking distortions
                   that underpin functional properties. Quantifying nanoscale
                   structural features with statistical significance, however,
                   is complicated by the subtleties of dynamic diffraction and
                   coexisting contrast mechanisms, which often results in low
                   signal-to-noise and the superposition of multiple signals
                   that are challenging to deconvolute. Here we apply scanning
                   electron diffraction to explore local polar distortions in
                   the uniaxial ferroelectric Er(Mn,Ti)O$_3$. Using a
                   custom-designed convolutional autoencoder with bespoke
                   regularization, we demonstrate that subtle variations in the
                   scattering signatures of ferroelectric domains, domain
                   walls, and vortex textures can readily be disentangled with
                   statistical significance and separated from extrinsic
                   contributions due to, e.g., variations in specimen thickness
                   or bending. The work demonstrates a pathway to
                   quantitatively measure symmetry-breaking distortions across
                   large areas, mapping structural changes at interfaces and
                   topological structures with nanoscale spatial resolution.},

                 It is challenging to make ML models fail because statistical
                 correlations can mimic the physics without causality. Here,
                 using a benchmark band-excitation piezoresponse force
                 microscopy polarization spectroscopy (BEPS) dataset the
                 pitfalls of the so-called ``better'', ``faster'', and
                 ``less-biased'' ML of electromechanical switching are
                 demonstrated and overcome. Using a toy and real experimental
                 dataset, it is demonstrated how linear nontemporal ML methods
                 result in physically reasonable embedding (eigenvalues) while
                 producing nonsensical eigenvectors and generated spectra,
                 promoting misleading interpretations. A new method of
                 unsupervised multimodal hyperspectral analysis of BEPS is
                 demonstrated using long-short-term memory (LSTM)
                 $\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) . By including
                 LSTM neurons, the ordinal nature of ferroelectric switching is
                 considered. To improve the interpretability of the latent
                 space, a variational Kullback-Leibler-divergency
                 regularization is imposed . Finally, regularization scheduling
                 of $\beta$ as a disentanglement metric is leveraged to reduce
                 user bias. Combining these experiment-inspired modifications
                 enables the automated detection of ferroelectric switching
                 mechanisms, including a complex two-step, three-state one.
                 Ultimately, this work provides a robust ML method for the
                 rapid discovery of electromechanical switching mechanisms in
                 ferroelectrics and is applicable to other multimodal

  abstract    = {Ferroelectrics are being increasingly called upon for
                 electronic devices in extreme environments. Device performance
                 and energy efficiency is highly correlated to clock frequency,
                 operational voltage, and resistive loss. To increase
                 performance it is common to engineer ferroelectric domain
                 structure with highly-correlated electrical and elastic
                 coupling that elicit fast and efficient collective switching.
                 Designing domain structures with advantageous properties is
                 difficult because the mechanisms involved in collective
                 switching are poorly understood and difficult to investigate.
                 Collective switching is a hierarchical process where the nano-
                 and mesoscale responses control the macroscopic properties.
                 Using chemical solution synthesis, epitaxially nearly-relaxed
                 (100) BaTiO3 films are synthesized. Thermal strain induces a
                 strongly-correlated domain structure with alternating domains
                 of polarization along the [010] and [001] in-plane axes and
                 90° domain walls along the [011] or [01 1 \textasciimacron{}
                 $\bar\{1\}$ ] directions. Simultaneous capacitance-voltage
                 measurements and band-excitation piezoresponse force
                 microscopy revealed strong collective switching behavior.
                 Using a deep convolutional autoencoder, hierarchical switching
                 is automatically tracked and the switching pathway is
                 identified. The collective switching velocities are calculated
                 to be $\approx$500 cm s-1 at 5 V (7 kV cm-1 ),
                 orders-of-magnitude faster than expected. These combinations
                 of properties are promising for high-speed tunable dielectrics
                 and low-voltage ferroelectric memories and logic.},

                 the interplay between polarization and electronic transport in
                 ferroelectric thin films has enabled a path to neuromorphic
                 device applications involving resistive switching. A
                 fundamental challenge, however, is that finite electronic

                 (PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3) on the level of a single nanodomain is
                 revealed. Tunable microwave response is detected through
                 first-order reversal curve spectroscopy combined with scanning
                 microwave impedance microscopy measurements taken near 3 GHz.
                 Contributions of film interfaces to the measured AC conduction
                 through subtractive milling, where the film exhibited improved
                 conduction properties after removal of surface layers, are
                 investigated. Using statistical analysis and finite element
                 modeling, we inferred that the mechanism of tunable microwave
                 conductance is the variable area of the domain wall in the
                 switching volume. These observations open the possibilities
                 for ferroelectric memristors or volatile resistive switches,
                 localized to several tens of nanometers and operating
                 according to well-defined dynamics under an applied field.},

  abstract      = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are broadly
                   applied in engineering and physics. A standard description
                   of fluid dynamics requires solving the Navier-Stokes (N-S)
                   equations in different flow regimes. However, applications
                   of CFD simulations are computationally-limited by the
                   availability, speed, and parallelism of high-performance
                   computing. To improve computational efficiency, machine
                   learning techniques have been used to create accelerated
                   data-driven approximations for CFD. A majority of such
                   approaches rely on large labeled CFD datasets that are
                   expensive to obtain at the scale necessary to build robust
                   data-driven models. We develop a weakly-supervised approach
                   to solve the steady-state N-S equations under various
                   boundary conditions, using a multi-channel input with
                   boundary and geometric conditions. We achieve
                   state-of-the-art results without any labeled simulation
                   data, but using a custom data-driven and physics-informed
                   loss function by using and small-scale solutions to prime
                   the model to solve the N-S equations. To improve the
                   resolution and predictability, we train stacked models of
                   increasing complexity generating the numerical solutions for
                   N-S equations. Without expensive computations, our model
                   achieves high predictability with a variety of obstacles and
                   boundary conditions. Given its high flexibility, the model
                   can generate a solution on a 64 x 64 domain within 5 ms on a
                   regular desktop computer which is 1000 times faster than a
                   regular CFD solver. Translation of interactive CFD
                   simulation on local consumer computing hardware enables new
                   applications in real-time predictions on the internet of
                   things devices where data transfer is prohibitive and can
                   increase the scale, speed, and computational cost of
                   boundary-value fluid problems.},

  abstract   = {In pursuit of scientific discovery, vast collections of
                unstructured structural and functional images are acquired;
                however, only an infinitesimally small fraction of this data is
                rigorously analyzed, with an even smaller fraction ever being
                published. One method to accelerate scientific discovery is to
                extract more insight from costly scientific experiments already
                conducted. Unfortunately, data from scientific experiments tend
                only to be accessible by the originator who knows the
                experiments and directives. Moreover, there are no robust
                methods to search unstructured databases of images to deduce
                correlations and insight. Here, we develop a machine learning
                approach to create image similarity projections to search
                unstructured image databases. To improve these projections, we
                develop and train a model to include symmetry-aware features. As
                an exemplar, we use a set of 25,133 piezoresponse force
                microscopy images collected on diverse materials systems over
                five years. We demonstrate how this tool can be used for
                interactive recursive image searching and exploration,
                highlighting structural similarities at various length scales.
                This tool justifies continued investment in federated scientific
                databases with standardized metadata schemas where the
                combination of filtering and recursive interactive searching can
                uncover synthesis-structure-property relations. We provide a

                 properties provides solid ground on which materials theory and
                 design can flourish. Recently, KAIST announced 10 flagship
                 research fields, which include KAIST Materials Revolution:
                 Materials and Molecular Modeling, Imaging, Informatics and
                 Integration (M3I3). The M3I3 initiative aims to reduce the
                 time for the discovery, design and development of materials
                 based on elucidating multiscale processing-structure-property
                 relationship and materials hierarchy, which are to be
                 quantified and understood through a combination of machine
                 learning and scientific insights. In this review, we begin by
                 introducing recent progress on related initiatives around the
                 globe, such as the Materials Genome Initiative (U.S.),
                 Materials Informatics (U.S.), the Materials Project (U.S.),
                 the Open Quantum Materials Database (U.S.), Materials Research
                 by Information Integration Initiative (Japan), Novel Materials
                 Discovery (E.U.), the NOMAD repository (E.U.), Materials
                 Scientific Data Sharing Network (China), Vom Materials Zur
                 Innovation (Germany), and Creative Materials Discovery
                 (Korea), and discuss the role of multiscale materials and
                 molecular imaging combined with machine learning in realizing
                 the vision of M3I3. Specifically, microscopies using photons,
                 electrons, and physical probes will be revisited with a focus
                 on the multiscale structural hierarchy, as well as
                 structure-property relationships. Additionally, data mining
                 from the literature combined with machine learning will be
                 shown to be more efficient in finding the future direction of
                 materials structures with improved properties than the
                 classical approach. Examples of materials for applications in
                 energy and information will be reviewed and discussed. A case
                 study on the development of a Ni-Co-Mn cathode materials

               components and new mechanisms to control electronic signals at

               and theory, however, most investigations on ferroelectric domain
               walls are still on a fundamental level, and reliable
               characterization of emergent transport phenomena remains a
               challenging task. Here, we apply a neural-network-based approach
               to regularize local I(V)-spectroscopy measurements and improve
               the information extraction, using data recorded at charged
               domain walls in hexagonal (Er0.99,Zr0.01)MnO3 as an instructive
               example. Using a sparse long short-term memory autoencoder, we
               disentangle competing conductivity signals both spatially and as
               a function of voltage, facilitating a less biased, unconstrained
