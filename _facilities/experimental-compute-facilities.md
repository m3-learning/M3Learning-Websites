The lab hosts several **high-speed servers** for **data transfer and computation**, featuring:
- **100 Gbps local networking**
- **Edge node with 2× U280 FPGAs & 1× H100 GPU**
- **4× 15TB NVMe RAID0** (20 GB/s read/write speed)
- **147 TB ZFS node** (RAID6 for durability)
- **Automated snapshots** to a secondary ZFS node at the university datacenter
