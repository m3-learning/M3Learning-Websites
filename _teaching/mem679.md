## Course Description
This course aims to equip engineers with the skills to harness the power of computational data analysis and machine learning techniques, particularly in the realms of experimental science and manufacturing processes.  

Rather than diving deep into the mathematical foundations of algorithms, the focus here is on providing engineers with the practical knowledge and tool sets required for applying these computational methods in real-world scenarios.
