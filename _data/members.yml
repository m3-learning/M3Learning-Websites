  teaser: "Dr. Theodore S. Beers Persian and Arabic philologist, specializing in the literary history of the late medieval and early modern periods—in particular the tenth/sixteenth century. Currently I have the good fortune to be working as a postdoctoral fellow (wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter) in the ERC-funded project AnonymClassic at the Freie Universität Berlin, under the direction of Beatrice Gründler. This affords me ample opportunity to explore both Persian and Arabic sources (and beyond) relating to the Kalilah and Dimnah tradition."
